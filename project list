Of course! This is an ambitious and fantastic goal. This list is designed to be a journey. It starts with fundamental syntax and logic, moves through core concepts, introduces external libraries, and culminates in advanced, multi-faceted projects.

**A Crucial Tip:** Don't just copy-paste code. Type everything out. The struggle of debugging syntax errors and logical flaws is where the real learning happens.
